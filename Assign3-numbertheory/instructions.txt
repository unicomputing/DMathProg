Extra credit problem:

There is one prerequisite if you didn't do the extra-credit programming
problems in Homework 2:

  Install any Python version to be able to run python as a command in a
  terminal.

  Note that you don't need to install Python if you use the CS labs (e.g.,
  New CS 106, to which all students in CSE215 have card access).

  I will hold extra help in New CS 115 during my Monday morning office
  hours to help those who need.


To get started:

a) Get the file div.py.

   It contains a program that you can start with for the programming
   problem below.

b) Run the following command

      python ...div.py a d

   where "..." is the path to your directory that contains div.py, "a" is a
   nonnegative integer to be divided, and "d" is a positive integer as the
   divisor.

   It prints "--------" followed by the quotient and the remainder of a
   divided by d.


Now the programming problem [12 points]:

Program the Euclidean algorithm on Slide 52.

You can do this by starting with div.py and modifying it.

Running your program using "python euclid.py a b" should print "--------"
followed by the greatest common divisor of a and b.


For submission, add you program file, euclid.py, to your single zip file
for submission.
