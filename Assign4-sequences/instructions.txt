Extra credit problems:
--------
First, get the file seqrec.da.

  It contains the program for you to start with for the programming
  problems below; you just must replace each occurrence of "TODO('...')",
  where "..."  is the hint for that occurrence, with your own code.

  Tip: Set the language in your editor/IDE to Python so you can see the
  syntax highlighting.

--------
Next, set up to run Python (and thus DistAlgo) on command line:

  If you have already run DistAlgo (by getting it using the "python -m pip
  install ..." command given in Homework 2), all you have to do now is to
  run the following command to get the latest pre-release (note just the
  extra "--upgrade"):

      python -m pip install --upgrade --pre pyDistAlgo

  Otherwise, the following two steps are the same as in Homework 2 except
  for (i) mentioning aggregation (sum and product) in addition to
  quantification, and (ii) using the program file seqrec.da in the command:

(1) Install any Python 3.7 (or 3.6) version to be able to run python as a
    command in a terminal.

(2) Run the following two commands:

      python -m pip install --pre pyDistAlgo

      python -m da ...seqrec.da

    The first installs DistAlgo, an extension of Python for programming
    distributed algorithms, but we will only use its advanced queries that
    include quantification and aggregation (sum and product).

    The second runs the program in seqrec.da, where "..." is the path to
    your directory that contains seqrec.da.

    Tip: If you have any problem with these two steps, you should do any
    and all of the following to have it solved: (i) google about it, (ii)
    ask a friend or classmate, (iii) post your problem in the Q&A Forum,
    (iv) go to an office hour, and (v) make an appointment with a TA or me
    if you cannot find time for any of the office hours.
