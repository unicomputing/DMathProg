Extra credit problems:
--------
First, get the file relations.da.

  It contains the program for you to start with for the programming
  problems below; you just must replace each occurrence of "TODO('...')",
  where '...'  is the hint for that occurrence, with your own code.

  Tip: Set the language in your editor/IDE to Python so you can see the
  syntax highlighting.

--------
Next, set up to run Python (and thus DistAlgo) on command line:

  This is as in Homework 4, except to use file relations.da in place of
  seqrec.da

  Tip: you must use DistAlgo, because Python will not be able to give you
  the witness needed for free in computing the transitive closure.

Now, the programming problems [18 points total]:

0. Prepare better [5 points: 1,4]

   Define a function that tests whether a number m divides a number n.
   Define a function that computes the transitive closure of a relation R.

1. Check a relation that uses intersection [1 point]

   Page 350 of textbook, Exercise Set 8.1 #6(b,c).

2. Compute ordered pairs in a relation and its inverse relation [1 point]

   Page 350 of textbook, Exercise Set 8.1 #11.

3. Compute ordered pairs in different relations [5 points: .5,.5,1,.5,.5,1,1]

   Page 351 of textbook, Exercise Set 8.1 #20

4. Check if a relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive [4 points: 1,1,2]
   Page 358 of textbook, Exercise Set 8.2 #7

5. Find equivalence classes of a relation [2 points: .5,1.5]

   Page 372 of textbook, Exercise Set 8.3 #10

Tip: Each TODO should be a few characters or at most slightly longer than
half a line.

For submission, add your program file, relations_sol.da, to your single zip
file for submission.
