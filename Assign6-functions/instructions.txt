Extra credit problems:
--------
First, get the file functions.da.

  It contains the program for you to start with for the programming
  problems below; you just must replace each occurrence of "TODO('...')",
  where '...'  is the hint for that occurrence, with your own code.

  Tip: Set the language in your editor/IDE to Python so you can see the
  syntax highlighting.

--------
Next, set up to run Python (and thus DistAlgo) on command line:

  This is as in Homework 4, except to use file functions.da in place of
  seqrec.da

  Tip: you must use DistAlgo, because Python will not be able to give you
  the counterexample for free when checking a function to be 1-1 fails.

--------
Now, the programming problems [20 points total]:

1. Defining function using set comprehension [5 points]

   Write the definition of function T in Exercise Set 7.1 #10.

2. Defining function to return pair [1 point]

   Finish writing the definition of function G in Exercise Set 7.1 #12.

3. Checking function to be 1-1 and onto [12 points: 1,5,5,1 for each part]

a) Write the definition of function G in Exercise Set 7.2 #7.

b) Finish writing the definition of function oneone that 
   checks whether the given function f is one-to-one.

c) Write the definition of function onto that 
   checks whether the given function f is onto.

d) Finish writing the print statement for function G, similar to that for F.

4. Defining composition of functions [2 points]

   Write the composition of functions in Exercise Set 7.3 #7.

Tip: Each TODO should be a few characters or at most slightly longer than
half a line, except that function G in problem 3 could be 4 short lines
like function F.

For submission, add your program file, functions_sol.da, to your single zip
file for submission.
