Extra credit problems:
--------
First, get the file sets.da.

  It contains the program for you to start with for the programming
  problems below; you just must replace each occurrence of "TODO('...')",
  where '...'  is the hint for that occurrence, with your own code.

  Tip: Set the language in your editor/IDE to Python so you can see the
  syntax highlighting.

--------
Next, set up to run Python (and thus DistAlgo) on command line:

  This is as in Homework 4, except to use file sets.da in place of
  seqrec.da

--------
Now, the programming problems [20 points total]:

1. Set operations: subset, difference, and Cartesian product. [2,4,4 points respectively]

   You must write the subset operation using quantification, and write the
   other two using set comprehension (also called set former or set
   builder) similar to the operation for set intersection in given file
   (you can write using either Python or DistAlgo syntax).

2. Write the set operations in Exercise Set 6.1 #12(f,g,h,i,j). [5 points total]

   You can use the set operations defined, similar to uses for
   #12(a,b,c,d,e) in the given file.

3. Write the set power set operations in Exercise Set 6.1 #33. [3 points total]

   You can use the power set function in the given file.

4. Write the set operations in Exercise Set 6.1 #35(c,d). [2 points total]

   You can use the set operations defined in the given file.

For submission, add your program files, sets_sol.da, to your single zip
file for submission.
