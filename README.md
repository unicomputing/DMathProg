# DMathProg

This is a collection of programming assignments, used for extra-credit
programming in teaching CSE215, Foundations of Computer Science, at Stony
Brook University in Spring 2020.

Note: Assignment 1 does not have a programming part; students learn to use
LaTeX as part of the assignment.


The "Exercise Set" numbers referenced in the instructions refer to those in
the textbook used for the course:

  Epp, Susanna S. 
  Discrete Mathematics: Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning
  Nelson Education, 2011.

The slide numbers references in the instructions refer to those used for
the course, available on the course page at

  https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~liu/cse215/

The DistAlgo extension of Python, besides installing by pip install as
stated in the instructions, can also be obtained directly from
